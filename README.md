# Cross Stream Player
    I am still new to this development thingy :)

## Just Like Twitch's Squad Stream

This project will let you watch livestreams simultaneously. You can also toggle on or off to see their live chat.

## `Proposed Features`

    1. Embed Livestreams (Done)
        - Embed or add livestreams from multiple streaming website (Facebook, Youtube, Twitch).
        - This allows the viewer to watch multiple streams in a cleaner way.

    2. See and Send Livechat.
        - Ability to sign-in your account to interact with both Streamer and Viewers.

    3. Arrange Blocks
        - Ability to arrange embedded livestreams

    4. Focused Mode
        - Focus on one stream (Enlarge a block so it seems focused)

    5. Remove Embedded Livestreams
        - Remove block (livestreams)
